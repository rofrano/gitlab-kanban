This project provides and command line interface for generating and manipulating Kanban boards on GitLab. It was built to help teams setting up their initial Kanban board with consistent labels and lists. It also has the ability to create stories that track assets.

## Installation

```bash
pip install gitlab-kanban
```

## Usage

You should set the following environment variables so that you don't have to specify them on the command line. This is particularly convenient when working in the same project for a while.


| Parameter| Variable | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| -t/--token | GITLAB_TOKEN | You GitLab authorization token |
| -p/--project | GITLAB_PROJECT | The unique ID for your GitLab project |
| -u/--url | GETLAB_URL | The GitLab url if not the default https://gitlab.com |

By setting those environment variables you can eliminate the need for using `-t`, `-p` on every call.

You can us the `--help` flag to get help on all of the commands.

```text
$ kanban --help

## Development setup

This repository contains the configuration files needed by the [Remote Container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that can be used with [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to bring up a complete development environment simply by starting VSCode and choosing **Restart in Container**.  

You can also create a development environment manually using a Python virtual environment (`venv`) and `pip` 

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```
